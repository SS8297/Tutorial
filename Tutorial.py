# This is a tutorial for how to use git.

# It is not neccessary to backup all of your current changes. Choose which files to backup by staging them. Only these files will be commited.

# In git, multiple people can work on multiple features by using branches.

# Changes on branches do not affect the main branch. This way, it doesn't matter if you break the code, you can always go back to main to run it.
